Java Programming Day29

Topics: OOP Inheritance

package name: day29_inheritance

Warmup tasks:
    1. Create a class named Student:
            private variables:
                name, age, gender, grade, schoolName

            Encapsulate all the fileds (at leat encapsulate two fields manually)
                    requirments:
                        1. age can not be less than 5 or greater than 90
                        2. gender should not be set to any chanarcter other than: 'M' and 'F'
                        3. grade should not be set to any chanacters other than: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'F'

            Add a constructor that can set all teh fields when the object is created
                        (requirments of fileds in the above must be applied)


            Methods:
                study()
                toString()



Encapsulation: hiding the data by giving private access modifiers

		getter (READ ONLY): public instance methods
							return type has to match with the data type of the instance variable
							passes no parameters

		setter (WRITE ONLY): public instance methods
							 return type is void
							 passes a parameter
