package name: day09_scanner

Warmup tasks:
	1. Create a class named CrewAndPassengers
		Given a number of people on the ship (int number)
		determine how many need to be crew members and how many can be passengers.
		Print how many of each type there should be.

                Total: 50  ====> 20 crew, 30 passengers
                Total: 75  ====> 25 crew, 50 passengers
                Total: 100 ====> 30 crew, 70 passengers
                Any other number of people on the ship is not valid

                Solution1: Use ternary. Do not use more than one println()
                Solution2: Use switch statement. Do not use more than one println()

    2. Create a class named NumberOfDays. An integer variable named month is given
        Use switch statement to write a program that can find the number of days in the given number of month.

                EX:
                    month = 5

                output:
                    31 days

                (Assume that February has 28 days)

            Hints:
            	Months that has 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
                Months that has 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11



Switch satement: switch, case, default, break

    syntax:

        switch(Data/Variable){

            case data1:
                Statements;
                break;

            case data2:
                Statements;
                break;

            default:
                Statements;

        }


        Switch' expression (Data) can not be boolean, float, double, long

        Case value must be UNIQUE, and must match with switch expression's data type

        break: used for exiting the switch

        default block gets executed if none of the case values matched with swithc' expression

        or logic we can use it in switch by declaring the case blocks back to back


import statement: used for importing one java file to another

        regular import: imports one single class from the specified package
            import package.className

        wild import: imports everything from the package
            import package.*;


Tasks:
    1. Odd or Even number
            1.1 Ask the user to enter a number
            1.2 determine if the number is odd or even

    2. Eligible or not Eligible to buy alcohol
            2.1 Ask the user to enter his/her age
            2.2 write a program that can check if the person eligible to buy alcohol

    3. MonthName
            3.1 Ask the user to enter a number
            3.2 Display the month name
